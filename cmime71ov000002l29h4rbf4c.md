Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is one of the fastest-growing and most impactful areas in the tech industry, but accessible, hands-on learning resources are still hard to find.

That’s why I created the **GRC Training Program**, a free and open source learning path hosted on GitHub. Whether you’re pivoting into GRC from another field, enhancing your IT knowledge, or preparing for certifications, this program gives you real-world tools, foundational knowledge, and guided modules to help you succeed.

## Why GRC?

GRC sits at the intersection of business strategy, risk mitigation, data security, and regulatory compliance. Companies rely on strong GRC practices to protect their operations, build stakeholder trust, and ensure long-term resilience. As digital threats grow, so does the demand for professionals who can bridge the gap between technical systems and organizational governance.

If you’ve been curious about breaking into this space, this program was built for you.
